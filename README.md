# Forward Looking Iteration Board

![screenshot](https://raw.github.com/RallyCommunity/ForwardLookingIterationBoard/master/flib.png)

This is a dojo SDK app that gives teams an idea of what future iterations may look like. Using past velocities for the team, future iterations are filled with stories from the backlog. This is done in a read-only, completely hypothetical manner, no actual story scheduling takes place.
  
## To Use
Create a Custom HTML app in Rally, and add the source of `ForwardLookingIterationBoardApp.html` to it.

## This is old code
This app was written quite a while ago, well before the new 2.0 SDK existed. Rewriting this app in the new SDK is a goal, but not sure when it will actually happen. Keep an eye on this repo for updates.
